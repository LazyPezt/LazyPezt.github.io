Hello! I am <ins>__a computer science major at California State University Fullerton,__</ins> who hopes to graduate in 2028. I have worked with 2 other langauges before, being <ins>lua and python.</ins> I am mostly into __game dev__, but net coding seems interesting as well. Which speaking of game dev, I am also in the CSUF VGDC, or the game dev club!

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

- __Lab 10, Part 1__

  I liked this lab for the most obvious reason that it was short. But I did actually enjoy using for each loops, since they are my favorite kind of loops, since I've used them in the past. I also think the way of going down the “rows” and “columns” was pretty cool to do. Only real thing I could’ve said about this lab is that it was longer, since it was a little boring for that reason, but all in all, it was a good lab.

- __Lab 11, Part 2__

  This lab was a good one, just because I really find the concept of object classes interesting. I found that classes were very similar to other things I’ve worked with, like lua. Other than that, I highly enjoyed using the member functions, because they’re pretty simple, (so far), and I like using them, since it feels familiar. The use of classes was probably the highlight though. I just wished we were prompted to write our own classes with that lab, since I think it would've helped a lot of people's understanding.

- __Lab 7, Part 1__

  This lab was SO difficult. It was easily one of the harder ones, but I liked the challenge that it had. Especially once I understood how to actually *code* what I needed to, it was pretty fun to do. Although I do think I made it harder for me and my teammate by making all of the if statements for the signs into only one if statement each. It could've been a little bit better explained though, since it definitely messed me up at the start.
