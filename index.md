## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

- Lab 10, Part 1
  I liked this lab for the most obvious reason that it was short. But I did actually enjoy using each loop, since they are my favorite kind of loops, having used them in the past. I also think the way of going down the “rows” and “columns” was pretty cool to do. The only thing I could’ve said about this lab is that it was longer, but all in all, it was a good lab.

- Lab 11, Part 2
  This lab was a good one, just because I really find the concept of object classes interesting. I found that classes were very similar to other things I’ve worked with, like lua. Other than that, I highly enjoyed using the member functions, because they’re pretty simple, (so far), and I like using them, since it feels familiar. Also I wished that we did more with the random number generator, and also I wished that we wrote our own class.

- Lab 7, Part 1
  This lab was SO difficult. It was easily one of the harder ones, but I liked the challenge that it had. Especially once I understood how to actually *code* what I needed to, it was pretty fun to do. Although I do think I made it harder for me and my teammate by making all of the if statements for the signs into only one if statement each.
